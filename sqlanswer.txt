// Assume this is the Schema SQL
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    Username varchar(255),
    Parent int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
INSERT INTO Persons(ID, Username, Parent) VALUES(1, "Ali", 2);
INSERT INTO Persons(ID, Username, Parent) VALUES(2, "Budi", 0);
INSERT INTO Persons(ID, Username, Parent) VALUES(3, "Cecep", 1);

// This is the ANSWER for the question

SELECT data1.ID, data1.Username, data2.Username as ParentUsername
FROM (
	SELECT ID, Username, Parent
  	FROM Persons
) as data1
LEFT JOIN (
	SELECT ID, Username, Parent
  	FROM Persons
) as data2 ON data1.Parent = data2.ID
ORDER BY data1.ID ASC
